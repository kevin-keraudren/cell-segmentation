\title{Voronoi-based segmentation on image manifolds}

\description{
Find boundaries between adjacent regions in an image, where seeds
have been already identified in the individual regions to be
segmented. The method finds the Voronoi region of each seed on
a manifold with a metric controlled by local image properties.
The method is motivated by the problem of finding the borders of
cells in microscopy images, given a labelling of the nuclei
in the images.

Algorithm and implementation are from Jones et al. [1].

\usage{
  propagate(x, seeds, mask=NULL, lambda=1e-4, ext, seed.centers)
}

\arguments{
   \item{x}{An \code{Image} object or an array, containing the image to segment.}

   \item{seeds}{An \code{Image} object or an array, containing the seeding objects of
   the already identified regions.}	

   \item{mask}{An optional \code{Image} object or an array, containing
   the binary image mask of the regions that can be segmented. If missing, 
   the whole image is segmented.}

   \item{lambda}{A numeric value. The regularisation parameter used in the
   metric, determining the trade-off between the Euclidian distance in the
   image plane and the contribution of the gradient of \code{x}. See details.}

  \item{ext}{Deprecated.}

  \item{seed.centers}{Deprecated.}
}

\value{
  An \code{Image} object or an array, containing the labelled objects.
}

\details{
  The method operates by computing a discretized approximation of the
  Voronoi regions for given seed points on a Riemann manifold with a
  metric controlled by local image features.

  Under this metric, the infinitesimal distance d between points
  v and v+dv is defined by: 
  \preformatted{d^2 = ( (t(dv)*g)^2 + lambda*t(dv)*dv )/(lambda + 1) },
  where g is the gradient of image \code{x} at point v.

  \code{lambda} controls the weight of the Euclidian distance term. 
  When \code{lambda} tends to infinity, d tends to the Euclidian
  distance. When \code{lambda} tends to 0, d tends to the intensity
  gradient of the image.

  The gradient is
  computed on a neighborhood of 3x3 pixels.

  Segmentation of the Voronoi regions in the vicinity of flat areas
  (having a null gradient) with small values of \code{lambda} can
  suffer from artefacts coming from the metric approximation.
