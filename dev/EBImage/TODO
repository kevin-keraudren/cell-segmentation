greg:
- subset [1,1:10] or [1:10,1] doesn't have the good orientation
- hullFeatures g.x and g.y are 0-based indexed, must be 1-based indexed
- test object functions when only one object is present
- replace DispatchImage by ExportImagePixels (available from >= IM 6.4.7)
- deprecate TrueColor and unused arguments
